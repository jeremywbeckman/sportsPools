'git pull'   //Pulls latest copy from the github repository
'setenv SECKEY bflpsecretbflp' //Sets secret key in tcsh ('echo $SHELL' to see what shell you're using)
'export SECKEY=bflpsecretbflp' //Sets secret key in bash
(In another terminal)
'sudo /usr/local/bin/mongod' <Enter your password> //Starts mongo database listener on port 27017
(Back to original terminal)
'gulp dev' //Starts web server listening on localhost:3000
Connect to localhost:3000 in a browser
Make an account on Create Account page
Login, all links on home page should have dummy pages they go to
Click your name in the navbar, that page is complete

To make yourself an admin user -
(In new terminal)
'/usr/local/bin/mongo'  //Connects to the mongo database with a command line shell
(at mongodb command line)
'use bflp'
'show collections'  //Should list system.indexes and users
'db.users.find()'  //Should show you a database document that is your user
'db.users.update({ username: "<insertYourUserName>" }, { $set: { role: "siteAdmin" } })'

Click 'logout' in the navbar, then re-login
You should now see extra links on the home page you didn't have before
User Management and Game Management pages are done

All web pages are in <sportsPools>/views.  They're named <file>.ejs.
There's an index.ejs that imports the smaller subviews in all the subdirectories
There's a proj.styl file also that can be filled with custom css, it's written in 'stylus' format, which
   gulp turns into official css files for the app, stylus is much more forgiving on format, as you'll
   see by the one example that's in there
If you're on chrome and you have livereload added to it, you should be able to click the very center
   of the recycle icon with the little tiny circle inside it to enable livereload (it's a very fine
   point-click right on that circle, you'll see the circle fill-in when it works)
If it fails, make sure 'gulp dev' is running
Once livereload is on, change 'green' in the proj.styl to 'blue' and save the file.  You should
   immediately see the browser change the header font color to blue.
   
Add teams to the database:
Open <sportsPools>/insertTeams.txt.  Copy and paste that whole file (yes it's kind of big) into the
   mongodb command line terminal.  Press return.
   Assuming it works, run 'db.teams.find()', you should see all the teams in all 4 major sports
Open the manage games page in the browser, make sure the teams in the dropdowns update right as
   the sport you select changes.
